Hello it's Claude here. Welcome special subscriber to this bonus edition of How Did We Get Here where we'll revisit some of our amazing guests to see how they're getting on now. Let's start by going back to Danielle. Her story entitled 'Grief Stricken Parenting' was first published on the 24th of March, 2020, the final episode of season one. There's a link in the program notes of this episode if you want to listen back. Danielle tragically lost her husband to cancer four years before she came to see us. She had high anxiety about bringing up her teenage children without him and how she would cope with the grief.
Danielle: I find it hard to really imagine life once you've both left home, it feels really daunting. I rack my brains, trying to think of things that will make us all feel better. It's a very lost feeling I have right now. I don't recognize myself. I don't know who I am, or who I'm going to become. If I could just stop being so worried.
Claudia W.: Danielle was focusing her worry on the children, but realized her intense anxiety was actually the fear of getting in touch with her emotions and addressing her own grief. Let's hear an update from Danielle after she recently caught up with Tanya.
Tanya B.: Danielle, it's lovely to see you. 
Danielle: And you. 
Tanya B.: Oh, it's been a long time, the last time I saw you, it was back, I think at the beginning of 2020 so, over a year and a half ago. Just before the pandemic and everything hit and life changed. We were in a recording studio together, weren't we, as I recall. 
Danielle: That's right yes, yep. 
Tanya B.: In terms of starting, I suppose, I'm curious to know, how you felt after our chat and what you, what you got from it really. 
Danielle: That train journey home, um, which I referred to in the recording, um, that I was nervous about that train journey home, but actually it was a nice way to just gradually gather my thoughts. But the biggest feeling apart from exhaustion was sheer relief. That it was a problem I needed to solve about me. It wasn't something that was out of control, that I was never going to be able to get on top of. It was something that could be managed. 
Tanya B.: Just to recap, not that long before you lost your husband, you'd lost one of your brothers. 
Danielle: Yep. 
Tanya B.: Both to cancer. 
Danielle: Yeah.
Tanya B.:  And you, then found yourself a single mum of two teenagers. Your youngest child, your son, then really struggled with his mental health. As I recall, we both sort of noticed that as your children were sort of doing well and getting sort of back on the horse and engaging with their lives in a way that, you know, felt good, you were actually interestingly becoming more and more and more anxious, so anxiety and your grief really became the focus. Are you able to talk a bit more about that, just in terms of what you remember from, from that narrative that we created on the day that we met? 
Danielle: Yes, it was interesting. So, you talked about me being grief-phobic. And in fact, my brother, before he died, he was the first person in the family I told, um, about my husband's diagnosis. And as we sat there, his, his reaction was, I know you're a tough old bird, thank you very much younger brother, um, but, um, but he said that you'll bottle it up, don't bottle it up, please don't bottle it up. And, uh, and the upbringing I'd had, it's, you know, you just, you just get on your stoic, you get on you, you just push through things and, um, you deal with it. And I thought that's what I was doing. And then suddenly realising with the way you were talking about avoiding grief, how I was keeping myself busy. It sort of brought all that together in a way that finally I understood what it was and that, that grief had now developed into anxiety. 
Tanya B.: But also, I remember when we talked about grief, you said to me, "but I can't afford to break". And it was then I think that you and I realised that the script, I suppose, the narrative that you were brought up with, um, you know, roll your sleeves up shoulders to the wheel, but obviously then comes these major catastrophes in your life, and that doesn't work. So, what you were doing, as I recall, is you were then projecting it outward. So, you were saying to me, "so I'm always thinking, you know, what's going to happen with the kids and if they feel this, will they be derailed?" so, that was the futuring wasn't it? You were beginning to say "so then I think, right, well, if I can see problems coming, cause I don't want this to break them, then I can solve them". And I was sort of saying, "Danielle, you've got to look after yourself". So, with that phrase, I can't afford to break, I'm interested to hear you then went into therapy, and you did learn about anxiety and you learnt to sit with your feelings. Tell me about that process, cause that must have been quite challenging for you initially. 
Danielle: I wasn't in touch with my feelings. I had to learn, how to understand what they were and then how to articulate that. And that was where the therapy, wasn't just, okay, just tell me about it. It was okay, take a stop there, you know, your, your husband's lying on a hospital bed. He's got your children on either shoulder and you know, what's happening. How did that make you feel? And, and to really get you to visualise that scenario and to talk it through. Through that process, then I could start to better articulate and start to make those links and gradually start to understand. 
Tanya B.: It sounds fantastic. I suppose the question that occurs to me is what was very, very clear to me when I met you was how anxious you were and how anxious you sounded. And anxiety, was the kind of go-to emotion for you and that sort of adrenalised you and fuelled you to roll up your sleeves and solve problems, but of course, with grief, that's, that's just not going to cut it, right? That's not how you do grief. So, anxiety then was getting worse and worse for you because you realised you couldn't change how you felt. How were you able to get past the anxiety to be able to contact the feelings? Cause it feels to me like the anxiety was the big block in the way. What, what did you do in therapy? How did you learn to manage that part of yourself? 
Danielle: Yeah. So, so to deal with the anxiety was where, um, I was introduced to different behaviors almost. So, tools like journaling. So, like the letter you asked me to write when we had a break during our session, and I wrote a letter to my daughter. Now, journaling in my head before I got into therapy was, oh, you just write down a bit like a diary, I thought of it as a diary almost to write down how your day is gone, and oh it's been a bit of a rubbish day, blah, blah. But actually I've realised that for me, journaling needs to be much more about right I'm feeling rubbish. Why am I feeling rubbish? What is it that's, that's led to that, or I'm journaling earlier today because I just can't get this day going. And I, I now write every day. Actually write it as a conversation to my husband. 
Tanya B.: Oh.
Danielle: And then as I'm writing it down, I can start to feel it lifting, but also sometimes, if it's, maybe it's a worry. I was also taught to, to, to look at my worries more effectively to pick them apart. What is the worry? How's it making you feel? How's it physically making you, is it making you feel different? So actually I spent quite a lot of time using that tool on, in the early on. Sometimes several times a day, and I could gradually feel myself each time I do this, it would make me feel better, and then it became just, I stopped having to write it down, I can, I would start just doing it almost as a reflex reaction. 
Tanya B.: So that sounds like just, sorry to interrupt, that sounds like cognitive behavior therapy, CBT. 
Danielle: Yes. 
Tanya B.: Is that what you're talking about? So, you were taught sort of how to manage the anxiety cognitively, so the anxiety, causes this kind of flurry, this whirl in the sort of limbic emotional areas of the brain, and then you were given tools and ways to question it through your wise brain, your prefrontal cortex, so you could settle it and also tools to deal with the physical effects of anxiety. 
Danielle: Yes
Tanya B.: So that was done. The CBT was put in in order to help you manage the anxiety, which then enabled you to move more squarely into the grief, because you could, you could manage the anxiety that was blocking you from contacting the grief feelings, is that right? 
Danielle: Yes. Yes, that's right. The other big thing the therapists, um, said was, um, that there is no end. You, you just, this is now what you need to do. I now recognise that whereas before, when I met you, I was anticipating that you'd have an answer, some ideas, in terms of what I should be doing, and that would get me to an end goal of "yay, you're sorted". That's it. Actually, what I have learned is it's like keeping fit, you can't stop. 
Tanya B.: Right. So, I mean, it's sort of unlearning maladaptive, thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, and learning more adaptive, healthier ways of dealing with anxiety. So, that, I mean, that's anxiety. Which I mean, it sounds like you've done so well, but then obviously what we haven't talked about is depression in terms of grief. So there must have been times then when the grief must've now come up? How did you deal with that then? I mean, it clearly hasn't broken you. I mean, you, you sound amazing. You look amazing. You sound empowered, but what was that journey like for you? Because now suddenly you're facing the feelings you've been avoiding for all these years, since your husband died. 
Danielle: That was quite a way into the therapy, where we really then touched properly on the grief, or moved into too to the grief itself and, for anyone who's listened to the original podcast we did, I did cry in my therapy. Um, so I was able to let a bit of that out, but also again, I needed to learn to sit with it. And, um- 
Tanya B.: And that was what terrified you. That, that sitting with it was what terrified you. So how did you learn to do that, and what was that experience like? 
Danielle: I, again, that's where journaling helped. Um, because actually I, and I would literally sit at the island cause it's a nice, it's an open area kitchen, and actually now I talk to you, I realised that that was the last room that my husband got us to renovate fully. It is a nice, safe space for me, where I can sit at that bar and, um, get the journal and just write, literally, "hi hon. I feel really sad right now" and, and I just put that on a page and just stop and just let it feel a bit and then pick up and write a little bit more. And by the time I've got to the end of a page, then I feel like I haven't avoided it. I've, I've sat with it. And, and for me, I literally, have to sit with it. 
Tanya B.: You grieve by talking to the, your husband who you're grieving for. So, you allowed yourself to, to feel the pain of missing him. 
Danielle: Yes.
Tanya B.: And you're guessing tearful now. 
Danielle: Yeah. Yeah, I am. Yeah, 
Tanya B.: But that's, but that's, that's strength, right? I mean, and that was the bit I, I, I I'm so proud of you, Danielle, because that was the bit that I was really worried about is that you just would not let yourself go there. And I just thought if she doesn't, she, she'll break, not in the way she thinks she will. She'll break because she will literally explode with grief. 
Danielle: Yeah, and it was, you were absolutely right in the podcast, it, it was the bit that really genuinely scared me. It was an interesting therapy session where we were talking about, um, the night it happened and I, and I was up at the hospital with the kids, I messaged them and I said, said, well, where he's gone. So, um, we're on our way home. And so my brother came around to my house as well, and we came in the house and, I remember he hugged me. I just howled this noise came out of me and it really scared me because it was something I'd never heard before it, from me. I didn't know I could make a noise like it. I, I think that is quite a primeval kind of howl and, and I, in some respects, wonder if that, at that point, I thought there's a bit to me that really scares me, and- 
Tanya B.: Yes. 
Danielle: That was almost a "right, I never wanted to do that again". 
Tanya B.: Right. 
Danielle: And that was possibly where the holding in came from? You go through therapy and you realise actually, yeah, these things are uncomfortable and deeply painful. And I think- 
Tanya B.: Not just your pain, but I think also the pain that you held for your children having lost their father so young. 
Danielle: Yeah. 
Tanya B.: And obviously, you know, you and you described earlier, they were both lying on each shoulder, I think next to him, when he died. The tsunami of pain you felt as he died just after he died, when he died, terrified you. Cause you didn't come from a family where the open expression of emotion was encouraged. So, in a way you did, you battened down the hatches and every time that grief tried to rear its ugly head, you'd either project onto your children. What can I fix for them? 
Danielle: Yes. 
Tanya B.: Or you just get so anxious because you're thinking "no, no, no, no, I can't. I can't break. I can't break". 
Danielle: Yeah, 
Tanya B.: Gosh this is, this is, so this is such an interesting conversation. Thank you for sharing so openly. The last thing I want to ask you is, um, your children, presumably they listened to the podcast and you wrote a letter to your daughter. And I suppose I was saying to you, I think your kids know that you need to grieve. I think you need to recognise that they'll be okay if you grieve. So, what, how did they react and have you been more open in your grief with the kids, and if you have, has it broken them? 
Danielle: Um. I'm more, much more likely to, um, answer when, when either of them say, how are you, um- 
Tanya B.: What in that way? 
Danielle: Yes, 
Tanya B.: yes, as in mum whats up kinda thing. Yeah. 
Danielle: Yeah, exactly. Then, then, um, um, much, I won't brush it off in a way that I, I was doing, I will now actually, say, actually I'm having a bit of a rubbish day. 
Tanya B.: And do they collapse into a pile of ash and fall apart and their life is over because their mum's having a bad day. 
Danielle: No. 
Tanya B.: Well, there you go. You see? 
Danielle: Yeah. 
Tanya B.: It's so fascinating. Isn't it? I mean, this has clearly been quite a life-changing process for you in terms of obviously grieving for your husband, with your husband through the letters you write in the journal that that's profoundly moving, that really moved me when you described it. And that you understand your propensity towards anxiety because of a need for control, because of a fear of being out of control, and so you've learned to manage anxiety and allow yourself to feel really strong feelings. What's next? Has it, has it, I mean, it's impacted you, you, you know, you sound like a woman who's learned a lot about herself. 
Danielle: We're actually in the process of moving. 
Tanya B.: The family home that you were all together and including your husband? 
Danielle: Yeah. 
Tanya B.: That's a big step. Yes. 
Danielle: It is a big step, it's um, a house he chose, I didn't want it cause it smelt of old lady, but he saw it as a renovation opportunity, so that's what we did. And he was absolutely right. And it's, it's been such, um, a, a safe and lovely home for us. And we've, it's grown with us and it's adapted to, to, how we've been as a family and it's, it's a big step to move it. But we'd always talked as a couple that once the kids went to uni, we would move. So that was always the plan. And, um, I was always aware once we'd lost him that, staying here without the children was going to be really tough and was something I, I wouldn't be able to do. So we're moving from the suburbs to Devon and I'm really excited about a, a fresh start. And I, I hesitate a bit because that's not to wipe-out or delete what has happened. It's about taking us to a place, I talk about this being a safe place. I've managed to find a place I believe is going to be our new safe place. It's going to give us something more hopeful and more optimistic if you like, instead of living in what we've lost, I'm hoping we're actually going to start living in what we can find going forward. 
Tanya B.: Wow.
Danielle: Um, but obviously take him with us in a way. 
Tanya B.: Knowing that he's not here, but that you're going to be okay. 
Danielle: Yeah, 
Tanya B.: Danielle, I hear how by understanding how you got to where you were, when you came to me, you've moved yourself into a place where you feel more settled, more empowered, and loving living life again, and you will have helped so many others by sharing what has been an incredibly painful, but clearly a very powerful journey for you. So thank you. 
Danielle: Wow, thank you. Because that session started it and gave me the confidence and, um, yeah, it's, it's been hard work, but it's been such a relief. And, um, thank you so much because I couldn't have started with that without you. So thank you. 
Claudia W.: How wonderful to hear from Danielle and the positive changes she's made. It's clear, she's found some space in her life to identify how she feels and is reaping the rewards.  
Now let's revisit Emma. Her story entitled 'I need peace with my brother' was first published on the 10th of March, 2020 in season one. There's a link in the program notes of this episode if you want to listen back. Emma contacted us because her brother had been abusive towards her at a number of family gatherings in recent times. Looking back, she realised he had often lashed out towards her. 
Tanya B.: He's in his late forties, early fifties. And he's verbally abusing you with such a level of aggression, that it discombobulates your entire family and he does it so that it affects your children. That's not okay. 
Emma: There's just no kindness there. There's no kindness. And I find it astonishing that he can function like that. 
Claudia W.: After a very emotional chat with Tanya, Emma felt empowered to react to her brother in a more assertive way, not only for herself, but to provide a positive example for her daughters. 
Tanya caught up with Emma recently. Let's hear how she's been getting on.
Tanya B.: Emma. 
Emma: Nice to see you. 
Tanya B.: So when did we lost each other back at the beginning of- 
Emma: January, beginning of January last year, 
Tanya B.: 2020. 
Emma: It was amazing. Absolutely amazing to come and see you. And I am very grateful for that. It really, uh, you know, it really tied things up for me. 
Tanya B.: Your podcast, really resonated with a lot of people and helped a lot of people I think. So, I think the thanks go to our contributors. The big story for you was this really difficult relationship with your brother who, I suppose not to sort of, soft soap it, I mean, he bullied you at times, but actually as we, as we went back in your history, we found that he had really done that a lot over your growing up years. Sort of with the complicity of your mum, who herself had quite a number of issues. And I think sadly, she died quite young didn't she from alcohol abuse. And she sounded, I remember you talking to me about your mother, this amazing, beautiful, vivacious, energetic woman who, whose life took her to a place where she was kind of frustrated, and, and I think you as her female child sort of bore the brunt of the projections, that she sort of pushed outwards in terms of her frustration and unhappiness, and elevated your brother to a place where he was sort of prince-like, and, and you were often sort of the butt of their, their teasing or, or, or sometimes worse, really. That, that's, that's I think where we sort of went back didn't we. We went back to how, how did you get there? How did you and your brother get there? 
Emma: Well, yeah, exactly. Very much so. 
Tanya B.: It's a sad story for, for everybody, for you. Sad for your mom and, and also sad for your brother in a way, because he was a child at that time. So, he kind of got caught up in something as well. I remember we talked a bit about that. 
Emma: Yeah, I really found that I'd been able to, uh, yeah, step forward from that, I felt, I felt very soothed by, by the session that we'd had. 
Tanya B.: Understanding can be very soothing, but hopefully understanding is also empowering. And we, we sort of went through sort of different ways of looking at the way your brother behaves towards you, and the way he makes you feel. And I remember just before the break, I sort of said to you, look hey, I think you've got two options here. One is you can decide that your brother can no longer be part of your life. And some people do that, some people do a estrange themselves from close family members. Or you could think about a different way to deal with these moments, and there have been, quite a number in your life with your brother where he will suddenly turn on you in the most aggressive way, which leaves you often just absolutely flawed. So you went off didn't you in the break and thought about that. And then you came back in and you made your decision. Do you remember what your decision was? 
Emma: I think just too, I mean, he lives abroad anyway, so it was just deal as and when. And, and I loved that actually it's just come to me now, but the empowerment of being with my girls and just stepping up to that and just being like, this is unacceptable, you know. 
Tanya B.: Let's talk about being assertive because you, I remember quite early on in the podcast, you described yourself as a people pleaser.
Emma: Mmm. 
Tanya B.: And actually, I think we started to think about that in the context of, not wanting to upset your mom, not wanting to upset your brother, because of being afraid of the reactions that you'd get from them. So it's a sort of learnt behavior from childhood. And we sort of linked that to you feeling utterly, unable to be assertive with your brother when he started to become aggressive. Tell me a bit about that, because that was something that I think you understood that you really struggled with. 
Emma: I mean, because it's just so, such a trigger that I just get completely floored by it, literally so overwhelmed, that I'm not actually able to sort of find myself, although that is part of myself, but it's, it just sends me spiraling into a place of so much despair, and anger, and sorrow, you know, it's sort of the pit. Yeah, not able to be assertive with him. But I felt that I could be after our session. I felt like I might be able to be. I'm getting much better in my life. Reading a fantastic book at the moment, Glenda Doyle 'Stop Pleasing, Start Living'. Um, but yeah, I do like pleasing. I do get a lot of joy from it, but, but from the people that I love and people who appreciate it, not, not from those that take it for granted and abuse it.
Tanya B.: But when your brother did take it for granted and over the years has abused it. I mean, suddenly I remember there was some incident with your dad, he was unwell, you were altogether, it was a Christmas, and you'd kind of suggested to your dad, you might want to go and have a rest because you were concerned, and your brother just absolutely lost, I mean, lost it with you, and your girls were sort of around so they, they heard it. Despite the fact, you know, you're a woman, you're a feminist in the sense that, you know, you are very much about empowerment and being assertive and that's what you want to teach your daughters. Do you remember, we talked about where it took you in yourself when you were in those moments, how you shifted from the woman, to back to being- 
Emma: The child. Yeah. 
Tanya B.: Helpless child. 
Emma: Yes, absolutely. It's a constant dance, but I'm hoping that, you know, with a bit of wisdom and a bit of age, you know, I definitely can swing a bit more to the, to the one that you know, is a bit more valid to my age and life experience. But yeah, it's fascinating that that can be like that, the sort of scorned child, uh, unaccepted, you know, um. Not seen and not heard, or not accepted, yeah, I, yeah, it's a funny one. I do remember that. Yeah. And I can, I can feel it very easily. 
Tanya B.: You can feel it now you look- 
Emma: I can. 
Tanya B.: You look a little bit sad. You suddenly look sad. 
Emma: I'm a bit sad this week, cause he stayed in west Hampstead and we lived just down the road with my dad, and my dad mentioned it yesterday and I'm like, he's just been over from America a couple of times to visit. And he, um, because we haven't seen him since the pandemic, I did an all singing, dancing, beautiful, you know, we had a lovely meal here, it was actually fantastic. It was so nice. And my kids just love bombed him and it was really special mainly for my dad, but also for my kids. And it was nice for me as well. And we had this beautiful, beautiful evening as he'd come in and I really made sure that we you know, found a time after his isolation from, you know, America, before he went up to Scotland to, to have this time. And it was absolutely brilliant. And we're having a bit of a laugh about how siblings can be an absolute nightmare and a bit of a sort of wink and a bit of, a bit of a chuckle. And then he came back from Scotland two weeks later, we did exactly the same thing, and again, it was absolutely magical, and my kids tickling him and, oh, they just so much love those girls have got to give. And I was just like, you know, spoiling him, rotten, really, you know, allowing that. And then my dad said to me, he came yesterday and said, oh yeah, and I said, it was funny, Justin, didn't respond to my text and didn't feel like he wanted to just see the nieces. Cause he made this big thing to the nieces about how it'd be lovely for them to come and stay with him and stuff. You know, and he didn't bother. And the fact that he actually stayed, I mean, if he'd been driving to Scotland and gone round the M 25 and not come in to London, that would have been one thing, but he actually stayed with my dad and I just went dad, you know I said, you can take a horse to water, but you can't make it drink. And I said, I just feel really sad for the, the girls and I feel sad for him because if he hasn't got his lovely nieces, he, you know, as a really beautiful ball of love, then where's he ever going to get that from? Because, you know, and my husband was, you know, he's like, well, forget it. It's such a shame. I just felt really sad for my dad, it's like, it's not such a big deal, it hasn't bothered me loads, but it's disappointing. I'm really disappointed. Because he could have easily popped in for a cup of tea, you know?
Tanya B.: Well, but that's not him, is it? That's what you want him to be, but that's not him. That's not him. And you've had two really nice times with him. Maybe that was- 
Emma: Plenty. 
Tanya B.: That was for him, that was what he could do. And there's something in you that runs away with all this and, and wants it to be played out in the way that you can see it could be played out, but you and your brother are quite different in a lot of ways. I mean, I can see that and it feels in a way, I think that the risk here is that you now see this, him not popping in when he was back as a, as a rejection, when actually I just want to encourage you to hold onto those two really lovely times you had with him. 
Emma: Oh, you're probably right. 
Tanya B.: Let's just talk a bit about that. If we can just rewind a bit. Do you remember what we worked on in terms of, when you're with your brother, how you could be in a different way that would either stop or at least reduce the likelihood of him bullying you. Or if he did, we worked on what you could do, do you remember? We sort of split it up into two parts.
Emma: I appreciate your upset or something, but there's, this is totally unacceptable to talk to me like this. And particularly in front of my children, I'm not gonna, you know, I'm not going to deal with it. 
Tanya B.: That's right. So the first part was sort of empathizing. I understand you feel frustrated, um, by what I've said or what I've done. So, number one is saying something that, it clearly communicates that the person has been heard. But then the second part is then being very clear about the way in which they've communicated it being completely unacceptable. It's like focusing on the behavior. It's interesting that's what you remembered, because when I, I remember when we did it, you were like, oh, I can do the empathy, I can do that, I understand you feel very sad about this, I can't do the assertiveness. Um, do you feel that that is something that has been clearer for you since we spoke, just being able to be more assertive? We also talked about being more assertive with your, with your girls, just generally with people in your life. Not always having to, have everything happy and shiny and everybody happy that sometimes, you know, it's okay to say "this isn't okay". 
Emma: Yeah, very much so. The pandemic was pretty, uh, you know, I'm in my privileged, lovely life with my nice garden, et cetera, but yeah, I definitely, I had the kids home for a really long time and I just kind of, you know, I hadn't put my oxygen mask on and by August I'd definitely given them everything and by that time I sort of started to crack a little bit. I didn't break, but it definitely started to crack a little bit. And I was just like boundaries, boundaries, boundaries. And I've just been really exploring that. Um, you know, there are times when it's just too much. The back chat, et cetera, as, you know, if you're exhausted, it can be quite easy just to sort of, you know, let the extra hour of TV roll on or whatever, but I've been trying to be a lot stricter, and I found things, definitely work. They need that. My husband needs it. I need it and things definitely work much, much better when I'm, you know- 
Tanya B.: More assertive. 
Emma: Yeah. And just the, putting the boundaries in there and keeping to them. Yeah. It's been really good, really good. I mean, I'm not always, you know, I'm not a, I'm not a master at it yet and it's been, um, life-changing. 
Tanya B.: I mean that's amazing to hear, it's music to my ears. Because for me, the issue was how you could let go of the legacy of the past and actually stay present as yourself, as a woman, as an in that moment mother, or partner, or sister if it's your brother who's being challenging. And you can find the voice inside you that can be clear and assertive and set a boundary. And that was something you always struggled with because you were always a people pleaser from childhood because you didn't want to trigger your mother or your brother, because you were afraid of what would come from that because they could often be quite nasty to you. Quite unpleasant. But just talk me through that. What does it feel like to now be able to do that? Because when we were practicing in the second part of the podcast, when we spoke over well over a year ago, you were like, I can't do it. I just don't have it in me. And then I said well, imagine you're doing it for your daughters cause they need you to be this version of yourself sometimes. Now try. And then you could. So tell me about how it's evolved, cause that for me feels like a significant shift. 
Emma: Yeah, it's been really good. I still struggle a little bit sometimes, you know, uh, with it, but I'm, knowing that it's for the greater good and that's, that's really, a brilliant reason and a brilliant cause. And I get quite, oh, just feel really we've had, we, you know, kids finished school this week. We've had sleepovers and kids here and you know, my kids going, no, we're not allowed to do that, and I'm like, wow, that's really exciting that they say that to their friends. It's not TV watching time. I know, and it's stupid, but I'm just, you know, it is just, wow. 
Tanya B.: You found your voice. 
Emma: Finding it. I would say finding it, I still get a bit funny. So the other day you have to sort of do something with my husband and I, I got in a tiz about it, you know, I then sort of barked at him about what it was that I needed, whereas I could have actually just gone, hey, I really think- 
Tanya B.: Yeah, but you know what, I mean, you're a human being and I think just, you know, FYI to you and people listening, you know, it's not about becoming this perfect human, who always times it right, and says it right, and there are moments where we do bark it, our partners, our children, our friends, that's life, right, that's life and that's okay. So, I suppose I just want to focus back on, on this though, from what you're saying to me, it sounds like in our conversation, we were able to identify why you could not be assertive, particularly with your brother when he was being abusive. And that was because when he behaved in that way and other people in your life, but particularly him, it took you back to a place in yourself that was a small anxious, very, very upset little girl, because that's what you felt over the years, growing up with your mother and your brother, particularly. It sounds like following our discussion, you've actually recognized that that child part of you doesn't have to be fully present in the moment when you need to find your voice as an adult woman. And that voice says, no, this isn't okay. No girls it's time to come off screens or, to your brother, I understand you're frustrated, but it is absolutely unacceptable for you to speak to me like that, particularly in front of my children, and I'd like you to stop. And it sounds like something about that conversation that we had has put you in a position where you're now able to access that voice in yourself and you're beginning to use it. That to me feels really great. 
Emma: Absolutely. Yeah. It's been life changing, really has. Just having a little bit of balls. 
Tanya B.: Or a really strong vagina. Let's not give it to the men. 
Emma: Yeah, OK, let's not give it- 
Tanya B.: You know, when balls are hit, they retreat up into the body don't they like- 
Emma: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
Tanya B.: -Cowardly, cowardly, custards, whereas, you know, you've had kids, so have I. Vaginas are bloody strong. 
Emma: Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, I'll go with that. 
Tanya B.: One other thing I wanted to ask you before we finish, it's a very difficult area, it was when you spoke about your grandfather, who was sexually inappropriate with you, I mean, sexually abusive. That was very moving part of our conversation, and I felt really privileged that you felt able to share it really. And then you also talked about the fact that your mother, who you suspect it may have happened with him, but you know, that she had been abused by, I think some other family member or a friend of the family or something. She had said something to your grandfather about what he was doing to you, but she had never come to you to comfort you about it. And you said, and that's the bit, I'm pleased to know, and I think you found out via your brother. 
Emma: I did, yeah. 
Tanya B.: Yeah, she didn't even tell you herself, but you were pleased to know that she had confronted her father, but you were sad, that she hadn't then come to you to comfort you. And do you remember how we thought about that? Do you remember why we thought perhaps that had happened? 
Emma: I just think because she, if it had, had happened to her, she just couldn't go there. 
Tanya B.: Absolutely. But what she could do was stop him, tell him to stop, but she couldn't go there with you. And if, there's something isn't there for a mother who's been through what your mother had been through in her own life to have a daughter who fundamentally had a lot more growing up then your mother had done. And I remember at one point us talking about the fact that maybe your mother felt a bit envious of what you had. 
Emma: They went off for three years. I mean, she was just, she was just kind of an inconvenience, always. 
Tanya B.: She never felt, sort of- 
Emma: Loved. 
Tanya B.: Absolutely. 
Emma: Cherished. 
Tanya B.: So it was difficult for her to know how to show you, but she did protect you. She did tell him to stop. And then we, then we talked a bit about, you said, you know what Tanya there's been, I think you used the word pervert, so I just seem to, there has been so many in my life. And you told a story, I think about on holiday in Greece, you went to buy sweet and some, some man, and we talked a bit about how predators can often see those children, and young people, and adults, who they can exploit. And generally those are people who have been abused because, you know, it's, it's difficult when you've been abused to be able to say "stop" or "no", you know, it's difficult to know where the boundary is. And that's something that you've been struggling with in your life, where is the boundary? How do I say stop or no? And we talked quite a lot about that and I suppose I was wondering these last two family occasions where you've had your brother there, and it's been great. I wonder whether he sensed something in you that felt different, which is why he didn't be aggressive. Without saying anything, just helped him see that something was different.
Emma: Yeah. I think, I think there might well have been. And the fact that I'm allowing him in when it's kind of so tricky, our past. 
Tanya B.: What do you think was the biggest take out for you from our chat. 
Emma: It comes back to boundaries and maybe sort of slightly different form. But I think that's also with the abuse, the sexual abuse as well. It's pleasing, isn't it, you're pleasing, you don't want to displease. So that's why you're going along with it. It all comes back to that. It's all about having boundaries, and if you don't have boundaries, you're vulnerable. And if you do, then you're powerful. You know, it's, it's literally that. So that's, that's what I would say. Being assertive, not needing to be, as my dad always said to me, be assertive, not aggressive. And I think with the aggressive, for me, it sort of comes into sort of anger, sadness, all that stuff. Just take a breath, and say it how you need it to say it, um, you know, respect your needs as well as everybody else's.
Tanya B.: And that I think is, is, uh, is, is really it's really well said. And if you think about it, your mother, for all the things that she didn't get, right. She did love you in a way that she wasn't loved. So she was an improvement for you on what she received herself. And now rolling forwards, you're improving it and strengthening it even more with your daughters. So this transgenerational pattern is not repeating itself. You just punched the air. Yes. 
Emma: It doesn't have to be. 
Tanya B.: It doesn't have to be. To be different is to understand how you got there in the first place. 
Emma: Exactly. How did we get there? Indeed. 
Tanya B.: It's been such a pleasure. Thank you so much. 
Emma: Thank you. Thank you very much for your time.
