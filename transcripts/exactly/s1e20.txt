EXACTLY. With Florence Given. Episode 20: RELATIONSHIPS Call In: Emotional availability, Attachment and Authenticity with Todd Baratz

Floss: [00:00:00] Hello. Thank you so much for listening to Exactly. With me Florence Given as always. I really want to thank you all for your support. I'm so happy that you've resonated with these conversations we've been having about relationships. In this podcast we've explored five big themes from multiple different angles, sex, social media, feminism, relationships, and 40 image.
Today we're on the last of the series on relationships and the last episode of season one. But don't worry. There's another season coming and we're ending on a high as I have. The incredible psychotherapist Todd Baratz with me to answer all of your burning questions about relationships. And I know I did just say that it's the last episode, but we have some very special bonus content coming your way.
For my very first live show for this podcast, I have the incredible Munroe Bergdorf as my guest, and I cannot wait for you to hear it.
Thank you so much to all of you who have sent in your questions and your voice notes and taking the time to send in your support and appreciation for the podcast. Today is our final [00:01:00] listener and a call in this season, and we're covering all things. Our relationships, friendships, romantic partnerships, family relationships are what fill our lives with meaning and teach us the most of ourselves. It's a cliche, but it really does all come down to relationships and we all hold mirrors up to each other.
What I find really amazing about relationships is that you learn so many different things about yourself, from your friends and from your romantic partners, from certain people who. Uh, mirror certain qualities of yourself back to you from certain people that you don't like, perhaps you don't like them because they remind you of yourself.
I just think that when we are in relation to other people, that's when stuff gets really interesting. That's when you learn about your triggers, you learn about your insecurities, you learn about what brings you joy and sharing that joy and love with other people. That's really exciting. 
We live in a time when the one hand we have access to so much helpful information on online, through podcasts and books, and we have massive exposure to concepts and ideas about relationships that [00:02:00] we have the potential to really grow in emotional literacy and maturity. But on the other hand this can then mean big complex subjects are reduced to memes, infographics and 140 character tweets. Terms like emotional availability attachment styles and red flags can all be used to label and even condemn what is often just a normal fluctuating kind of behavior. At worst, it can actually work against us and driving us further apart, giving us unrealistic ideas of what relationships should be, stopping us from actually approaching people and situations, curiosity, and open-mindedness. This is exactly why I love my guest today.
Todd Baratz, he doesn't subscribe to labels and actively debunks a lot of the common misconceptions that get shared often out of context, on social media. Todd is a certified sex therapist, licensed individual and coupples psychotherapist and writer who specializes in relationships and sex. Online, his account @yourdiagnonsense.
Well therapy, one brutally honest post at a time. He's a proud queer man and he communicates in a way which makes it okay to feel the many different things [00:03:00] we all go through. He says, he's not interested in formalities, tradition and diagnosis or labeled. In fact, he actively works against any categorical binary of the human condition.
Instead he works to humanize and empower. So I really couldn't be a better company today to answer all of your questions. I've also just realized he's the first man on my podcast.
Okay, Todd, thank you so much for coming on my podcast today. Um, I can't wait to chat to you, but first of all, I'm going to go through my five quick fire questions that I ask all of my guests. Just say the first thing that comes to your mind. Okay. Well, it's one thing that's sets your soul on fire. 
Todd Baratz: French fries. 
Floss: Amazing what condiments you're having with the French fries? 
Todd Baratz: Mayo and ketchup
Floss: gorgeous, mixed together?
Todd Baratz: Um, I like to separate piles because then I can have just may just catch up or both. 
Floss: If you could, wear one outfit for the rest of your life, and look there would define you forever. What would that outfit be? 
Todd Baratz: It's probably what I wear every, every day, which is just jeans and a t-shirt and my vans, as much as I want to put on fancy, [00:04:00] fun fashion. I just, I wear the same jeans and t-shirt every day. And I'm fine with that. 
Floss: Okay. Todd, next question. What's something that people frequently misunderstand or get wrong about you? 
Todd Baratz: There's so much, um, maybe that I'm aggressive or maybe that I'm disinterested or bored. 
Floss: Why do you think people would think that?
Todd Baratz: Um, just because the aggression, because of sometimes the way that I write and disinterested or bored, just because I have this very, like, sometimes therapist's blank stare kind of thing going on. Um, so, but that's not true. 
Floss: Next question, finish this sentence. I'm still a work in progress when it comes to, 
Todd Baratz: um, I mean everything, the reason why I write and think and talk about the things that I do is because I'm actively writing and thinking and talking about the things that I'm doing, writing.
Um, so everything, relationships, sex, stuff like that, all that. 
Floss: Okay. Last question. When was the last time you majorly cringed at yourself? 
Todd Baratz: Majorly. Oh God. All the time. I recently had an [00:05:00] interaction with an ex that I really wish I didn't. I was like, oh God, why did I say that? Can't I just control myself. But no, I couldn't.
It was a text. Yeah. It was like, can I just really not don't don't press send. 
Floss: I think we've all done. We've all done. Stupid shit like that. 
Todd Baratz: Yeah. It's like uncontrollable apparently. Yeah.
Floss: Okay. So Todd, I followed you on Instagram for around a year. Um, a friend sent me your account. It was like, I think he might fucking eat their shit up and love it. Um, and I absolutely love your content. I feel like it's very refreshing. Can you talk a bit more about why you started talking on Instagram, almost acting as the therapist yourself, but I feel like you're very anti black and white when it comes to Instagram therapy, like you like things to feel very nuanced.
I'll admit it's very hard to do. 
Todd Baratz: Yeah. It's really hard to do. And thanks for saying that I've been following you for years. I'm a huge fan of yours. Uh, I love all of your work. Yeah. I mean, [00:06:00] nuance is really hard. Complexity is really hard. People want answers. Yes or no. And sometimes it's that clear, but most of the times, especially when it comes to relationships, it's pretty complex.
So, um, I do try to really increase the volume on honoring complexity and the paradox and the existentialism that really defines what it means to be alive. Life's really fucking hard. And, you know, it's. I wish it was simplistic, but it's really not. Um, so yeah, that's a lot of what I try to bring to my Instagram about relationships and sex.
Um, and that's what I do with my clients in session. 
And what made you want to add? What I feel is very counter narrative to Instagram 
therapy, um, my own personal experience in therapy and what has been most helpful for me. And also in terms of seeing what all the shame that my couples, who I see come into me, really feeling a lot of shame and anxiety.
Um, coming in with this information they've learned on through Instagram or blogs or web MD or wherever and realizing that, okay, people are really freaked out about this stuff. And there's a lot of information that's not wrong, but it also like [00:07:00] really fails to convey the complexity of individual experiences and contexts and identity and race and gender, and a lot of stuff and culture that really shapes how we experience things.
So, you know, both in terms of my own personal experience and my life. And, uh, as a therapist, you know, it became really. A lot of this was lacking on Instagram. So I was also bored. So I started Instagram. 
Yeah. Okay. Amazing. Well, I can't wait to talk to you today with some of the questions that we have from my listeners.
Floss: So here we have our first listener question. This is a text from Amy. She says, I want you to ask how to cope with relationships we can't really control, such as work relationships. I'm a woman that works in tech, which means I'm in an office space, which isn't my vibe, a lot of backwards opinions. And I'm constantly being mansplained to by middle aged white men in middle management. But obviously I don't want to give up a place in a space. I worked so hard to be in, but I'm finding it hard to not take on what they say too much and take their comments [00:08:00] home with me. Do you have any advice? 
Todd Baratz: I mean, well, it sounds awful, but I wish I could say I haven't heard this before, but this is pretty common, especially in tech, but really in any industry, women are really mistreated as a lot by, um, the men that they're working with.
I would say pushback. I think setting boundaries is really important, especially if people are being explicitly or implicitly aggressive or mistreating or mansplaining in a way that feels, um, offensive. Uh, I think it's really important to say that, um, and you may have to say that multiple times and if you do, and it really becomes a really aggressive, I mean, I think it's okay to talk to HR about that too.
I mean, obviously this is easier said than done, you know, it can be scary, especially if there's some kind of power dynamic. So many people work in environments that really aren't affirming. And then the question becomes. How much can we tolerate and how much should we tolerate? You know, it's easy to say shouldn't tolerate anything.
But the reality is, is this happens like everywhere. So we can't control the people in the environments, but we can control the environments that we put [00:09:00] ourselves in, you know, depending on how bad it is. I would say, get the fuck out of there if, if it's really uncomfortable and unsafe and, and unaffirming.
And cause if that's the case, you know, we can't thrive in those places. We can't be happy or satisfied in those places. 
Floss: I really liked that you have the same approach to relationships as well, not avoiding conflict, addressing conflict thing, because I think a lot of people now it's actually comfortable to just avoid conflict and cut everyone out of our lives.
And so I liked your initial suggestion of plucking up the courage to actually assert yourself and then maybe having to do that multiple times. I think the first hurdle for people is that it is initially frightening because we think of what we have to lose and we already assume the reaction. Of the other person before we said anything.
So we almost count ourselves out of ever being able to have that confrontation and then building up all of this resentment to a person and the confrontations that I've had with many people where I have told them how I felt every single time. It has surprised me how speaking [00:10:00] completely resolved the situation.
So now we have a voice note from Lilly. 
Voice note 1: Hi Florence in the Exactly team. Firstly, I just want to say a massive thank you for creating this podcast. I think it's really important that conversations like this are held and I've already learned a lot from the podcast so far. Um, so my question is around validation from unreadable people.
And for me, this has shown up as people who are either difficult to read or people who wouldn't be able to compliment me, whether um, it's seen as inappropriate, so maybe teachers managers or mentors, and in other areas of my life, I'm so confident, but I find myself craving and validation physically and academically.
So I'm like really disappointed in myself when it comes to how insecure I feel around these people that I admire. I'm really not sure where this comes from. Maybe. Because I was a high achiever in school, put a lot of work into my achievements. I'm not sure. So any advice would be much appreciated. Thank you.[00:11:00] 
Todd Baratz: I mean, I have a lot of followup questions, but it seems like there's a lot of meaning behind what sounds like a very confusing relational experience. I would just want to know and help her create parallels between the experiences she's had, she's having now and the feelings and how they might be a reenactment of earlier experiences with her parents or whoever raised her.
This is being motivated, and this is a relational reenactment that comes from a really meaningful place. 
Floss: Could you explain to anyone who doesn't know what a relational reenactment is?
Todd Baratz: Sure. 
So as human beings, everything we do is learned, um, from walking to talking to love, to sex, to math and driving. And so we re-enact everything.
And it's specifically a relational experience. These re-enactments and we end up with people who often have similar limitations or we create similar dynamics or have similar conflicts with our adult partners or even friends as we did with our parents, um, or whoever raised us. So we all [00:12:00] reenact things. I think there's so much information out about these patterns being a bad thing, but it's simply just how we are as human beings.
We live in patterns, we create patterns and that's how we learn. Everything about our past informs our present; who we choose as partners, why we want validation from certain people and not others, why we feel secure with some and insecure with others, blah, blah, blah. So this is basically our story. 
Floss: So relational reenactments is almost like the correct and proper way of what other people call mummy issues and daddy issues on social media.
Todd Baratz: Yeah. 
Floss: Yeah.
Todd Baratz: Exactly. 
Floss: Okay. So yeah, also Lily said that, uh, the disappointed. With themselves for feeling this way. And I also think that actually seeking validation is a very normal thing. We want to know that the people around us, at least like us or enjoy our company for me, it's when I'm overextending and doing things to get someone's approval.
That I think that is something that needs to be really inspected there. But if it's just a kind of general. This person's really cool. And [00:13:00] I'd like them to like me. I think that that's normal, especially with when it's like in a peer group of people that you want to get on with, or someone you want to be friends with someone, you look up to it.
I think it's about for me anyway, when I've had those moments, it could turn into jealousy or it could turn into a dislike towards the person where I'm like, oh, I just don't like them. I can't put my finger on it. And actually I'd love to be their friend that there are so many different ways. Our feelings can project onto other people.
Um, and sometimes they say a lot about us and sometimes it says nothing at all, and it's just a completely normal thing that we want the people around us to like us also, I feel like a lot of people who messaged me as this podcast. So like, is this. It is, and it happens to a lot of people. 
Yeah. Very normal.
Todd Baratz: And everyone is walking around, freaked the fuck out thinking that there is some sort of crazy when the reality is, is they're living a very normal human life. That's imperfect and has challenges because they went through something when they were younger. You know, people often say, you know, we don't need external validation.
We should just, you know, love ourselves and blah, blah, blah. And it's kind of bullshitting because, you know, the fact of the matter is, is the [00:14:00] people around us, the communities around us are important to us and we want it to be like, okay, A hundred percent. Okay. And very normal that we would want someone we respect to also respect and like us too.
Floss: Okay. Next we have a caller. Madeline. So nice to meet you. Thank you so much for calling in today. What would you like to ask us? 
Call in 1: So my question is basically to what extent can you heal your attachment style or wounds? Because. It's hard out here for an anxious bitch. Like it really is. And I have done some kind of in a work I've done a lot of reading, but still things keep coming up and I'm just like, oh my God is this a lifelong thing? 
Floss: Anytime I start dating someone new, I walk out my copy of, uh, attached the book. I feel, I feel the exact same in that it's almost this fear of the insecure [00:15:00] attachment style coming up again. So I'm, I'm totally there with you. I would love Todd to have some words to say on this one.
Todd Baratz: Yeah. Well, I mean, one, I think it's really great that so many people are thinking about their attachment styles, which is thinking about how the relationships you had with your parents growing up are impacting your adult relationships. So that's like really great. What I will say though, is that people have become a little bit too obsessed with about attachment in terms of investing in the belief that there is some kind of version of ourselves that exists or relationship that exists that is, you know, fully secure and that will be free of anxiety and fear and et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. And you know, the reality is I'm sorry, is it doesn't exist?
It's ongoing. The quality of our adult relationships are fundamentally insecure. Um, meaning they can end if we don't do our part, they can end if our partners suck. We can break up with them. If someone cheats on somebody, we can either decide to repair or to totally leave. You know, that the reality is is that our [00:16:00] relationships, our insecurity.
You know, I'm not saying that attachment styles are irrelevant, but I am saying is that that's not all there is to the story. I would encourage you to not to think about how do I get to a place where I'm better. There's nothing wrong with you, how you are today in terms of how you attach and how you connect.
And even the anxiety that comes up, you know, there's nothing pathological or wrong about that. If someone is not being responsive and it makes you anxious, how are you supposed to feel? It's, it's a scary thing sometimes. And it does depend on your history. 
Call in 1: Does it sort of coincide with like the partner in which you're with? Does it kind of take like two to tango essentially? Like it's something that you can work with, but then there is also like this element of, well, is this just not my needs being met? Like where's the line is. 
Todd Baratz: Well, it's, it's usually both, you know, this kind of thing of is my trigger. Something that's being triggered in the present or is this about my past, right.
It's kind of what you're saying. And it's usually both, of course it [00:17:00] gets to a point where, okay. If someone's not responding to our texts, um, if that's something that's ongoing, it's every day they suck at texting, you know, it's something to bring up and be like, what's going on. I noticed that you don't respond to my texts.
Are you busy? Are you just not a big texter? And it becomes a negotiation, but if someone's not responding to your texts, that's annoying and frustrating. The lack of communication is ridiculous. We're all walking around with phones in our hands, practically attached. So of course it's going to be annoying.
And if that's something that's consistent and it's regular, that might not be workable for you. Is it also triggering some older stuff about your attachment? It could be, but there's no like nasal swab or blood test. And we just kind of have to trust ourselves, which is really what this is coming down to in terms of understanding how you want to manage and deal with it.
But it's usually not a matter of, is it my fault or is it their fault? If you're feeling anxious, you're feeling anxious. You don't have to validate it or invalidate it or think it's right or wrong. There's no wrong feeling. You're feeling what you're feeling and that's, you know, a hundred percent right. For you.
And it's coming from both the past and the [00:18:00] present. 
Floss: Madeline, do you feel like this is something that happens a lot with dating? Do you feel it with friendships at all? Because for me, I realized that it was in a lot of the cases, the people I was dating, being flaky or being avoidant, whatever you want to call it, because I have friendships where they won't text me for days, they won't respond to a text. And I still know that the love is there and it doesn't make me feel anxious in the same way. And I started looking at the connections that I had, and maybe that's because these friendships have existed for years. Right. And there's no kind of uncertainty there and that. To that, but I wondered if you just feel this very mantic relationships or you feel that some friendships as well.
Call in 1: For me personally, it's not with friendships whatsoever. Like I have peer friends and like, it does not matter if we don't speak for days on end, but I think it's more from like past trauma in relationships and definitely with like my family upbringing and my relationships with my parents. I [00:19:00] think it manifests more in romantic relationships and I was a suffer of a narcissistic.
And I now am having healthy relationships, but this like anxiety is still very present. And I'm constantly kind of saying to myself, you know, is this anxiety valid or is this because I'm like almost waiting for this person to just completely like turn into this, like Jekyll and Hyde, like really kind of horrible person.
You're never going to have a good relationship if you are constantly like waiting on it. But then at the same time, my body and my nervous system, can't help being like, this is it they're gonna fuck you over now. You know? And I'm like, baby, you're never gonna enjoy anything if you're just constantly waiting for it? 
Floss: Yes. I feel like, I feel like you're speaking.
I feel like you're speaking my diary right now. Um, it's like almost like you're waiting for someone to pull the rug from under you the jacket and hide thing, especially you're waiting for the mask to slip my one [00:20:00] tip with dating when it comes to that stuff is just consistency. No one can keep up the facade for that long consistency is the only way for me to breed trust with someone.
If there's any kind of like mixed signals for the person, or I'm like confused about whether they're into me and then extremely excited when they do text back because. They've been ignoring or whatever. That's when I know that not that there are a horrible Jekyll and Hyde, but that maybe they're just emotionally unavailable and not available to date me saying it is hard to, to discern.
Call in 1: Do you think of an avoidant and an anxious attachment style could ever come to a middle ground where they're not like majorly triggered by each other. 
Todd Baratz: Yeah. I mean, again, I would, I would really kind of try to loosen your grasp around the kind of categorical approach to loving, um, an attachment. It's like one ingredient to a really complicated recipe.
And, you know, if you're particularly anxious, maybe it's not a good idea to pursue somebody who is withdrawn or [00:21:00] avoidant or any of those things. Right. I mean, I think it's very challenging. Um, could they work it out? I don't know. People have work things out all the time. People are together for decades and decades and they're somehow find a way to make it work.
I think the question has to be less so on. Can person type one, go with person, take two and more. What am I feeling? Can I trust my feelings? Can I come to my partner with those feelings? Can we have a conversation around them? Can they understand me? Can I understand them? And do I feel safe? You know, relational safety is a really big deal.
And if you've been in abusive relationships, as he said, you have, it's going to bring that stuff up for you. So the last thing you want to do is engage with people who are similarly in. It's so difficult. 
I tell they ought to say, you know, one of the difficult things in terms of dealing with the narcissist is if they're a parent or something like that, you know, as you really lose the ability to trust yourself and that's really.
What's some of these questions come down to is, um, can you trust that your anxiety and how you're feeling as it relates to something you're picking up [00:22:00] on and believing that that's at one normal and okay. To pick up on and feel and to, to confront or ask or communicate with the other person and then three evaluate, if you are feeling safe enough and their response to how you're communicating your worries.
Um, and so we're talking about self trust. Um, and believing in yourself. 
Floss: That's interesting, Madeline, I highly recommend following Todd on Instagram. All of his content about dating is incredible. And I feel like everything we've been asking us, um, is just going to be incredible followups for the questions you've asked us today.
Okay here, we have a text from Georgia. Is it possible to build trust back up once it's been ruined in a relationship, my girlfriend and I recently broke up due to this and I'm scared it's never going to be exactly the way it was before. I really don't want to lose her. We are currently friends. Of course we would be because we're queer.
Thank you. 
Todd Baratz: Yeah. I mean, it really just depends on the context if [00:23:00] someone's like, yeah, I betrayed you and I don't fucking give a shit then probably not. Um, but if somebody is willing to work with you and actively work on rebuilding trust and reconnection and repair, then that's another thing. Um, you know, specifically Georgia is asking about, you know, can this relationship workout and can we get back together.
If she wants to get back together, you know, that's something to talk about. You know, if they're friends. With the secret motivation that one day, they'll get back together, it's something really to address, sooner than later, because I think the few want to work on rebuilding trust. You have to actively and consciously and intentionally embark on rebuilding trust.
Floss: Yeah. I, I felt like a lot of these questions just come back to the person, trusting themselves and trusting their judgment. So again, we don't have all the context of this and we also can't tell anyone who listens to this podcast, what to do with their lives. And I feel like a lot of these questions about like, you know, can I trust this person again?
I think what you said Todd about know, uh, becoming friends with someone with the secret motivation to become [00:24:00] romantic with them again, that would definitely need addressing even just with yourself, if that's honestly the reason why you want to stay friends with this person. And I think too, of course, trust can be rebuilt again.
I've done it myself. I've had awful relationships. I've had really bad things happen to me, but there are still good. People in the world. And there are people who you can trust and people that you can build new foundations with. And if you feel like maybe you need some distance from this person, because it's not a nice reminder.
And that doesn't mean having to cut the person out. That could just be a conversation of look, it's really hard for me to be around you. I hope you understand, but I'm good. I'm going to skip these social interactions. I think there are so many ways that you can communicate your feelings without them brewing and festering and becoming uncomfortable to be around and sit with.
Okay, next question. Here is a text message from anonymous. I feel unlovable. [00:25:00] I want a relationship, but I just cannot understand why anyone would ever want me or ever find me attractive. I came out of a two year relationship a few years ago and he asked me to hide our relationship from our friends for the first six months.
And I don't think his parents knew about me either and I never met them. I think he was embarrassed to be with me. And now I just can't see why anyone would want me. I use dating apps, but I took myself off of them because I couldn't help but think everyone matched with me as a joke and that they're going to make fun of me.
How do I get out of this mindset? That's so that's, I'm so sorry. That sounds really horrible. And I'm sorry that someone hid you and made you feel like a secret. That's not very nice. 
Todd Baratz: I mean, this makes me sad. 
Floss: Me too, is that it's the fact, the first three words I feel unlovable. Um, I can relate to them to a different extent, and that goes back to like high school experiences or whatever, and I've unpacked all the stuff, but it doesn't make it hurt any [00:26:00] less, understanding why you feel that way.
And I think those feelings are very real. 
Todd Baratz: Yeah. I mean, it can really, when we have our relationships, it really erodes the ability to trust or love ourselves. If those relationships are really toxic or unhealthy, or our partners are mean to us or were already coming to the um plate, with a history of neglect abuse or abandonment, I'd imagine that the sense of feeling unlovable is a really big theme and belief that's been present for this person since they were younger.
Um, and it just, it sounds sad. Um, you know, in terms of feeling so undeserving and undesirable and lacking value. 
Floss: So the last, the last part was, how do I get out of this mindset? And I can only speak from my experience. So I was kicked out of a friendship group in high school. And like, that is when that is your peak need to be liked by your peers is when you're in high school.
And it all, it feels like death to be rejected by the people around you. And I kind of leaned into being alone. I personally found a lot of liberation [00:27:00] freedom in it because it meant that. I no longer had to be who anyone else told me to be, I started reading books. I started listening to different music.
It was, for me, it was a really empowering experience. A lot like breaking up from someone where I started to have to like who I was and it made it easier to like who I was because there was no one around me to even affirm what I was doing. Anyway, I did a lot of things in private, like journaling and like reading all of these books that I was embarrassed to tell other people about.
Um, I started to really like myself when I started to do little things that scared me. And that would be small social anxiety things like asking someone for the time or going to the store to buy a book. I know it sounds like. Silly and small, but those little confidence building exercises that I did meant that I trusted myself to be able to do the things that I need to do.
And then over years, those kinds of small acts of courage. Accumulated and meant that I liked myself and I liked my voice and I saw what I [00:28:00] brought to the table. I think there's a lifelong journey. Also, everyone, everyone has days of doubt. Everyone has moments where they're brought back to a place where they felt like shit.
But I would also advise if you have any trusted friends talking to your friends about this, because your friends have likely felt a little dose of this themselves before. And I think your friends can reflect back to you how they view you. The words that I hear come out of my friend's mouth about their bodies, about themselves, it it's so it's scary to me because it's so wildly contrasting to how I view them and a simple conversation with all the things I love about them, that aren't physical has lit their faces up and sent them to tears because they finally see, they didn't know that they could get that validation from friends.
So if you have any other friends also, I would recommend talking to your friends and being honest about how you're feeling. 
I'm sorry. You had to go through that. Um, that sounds pretty awful. Um, but it also sounds like you did a lot of work, really impressive. Um, to move through it. 
Yeah, yeah, [00:29:00] yeah. From a really young age as well.
I was about 14 years old. Um, and it just kind of sprung me into being on my own. And I found that really empowering. And I did it again after a breakup a few years ago. It was almost like life had forced me to leave these situations because it knew that I was, I needed to do something else, something bigger and something better, and that I wasn't willing to make the choice myself.
But yeah, I really hope that, um, some of the tips that I gave that about finding yourself and, um, those little acts of courage that can build up, I think you just need to like yourself, like, forget the love thing and loving who you are. Just think about little things that you can do. To help you like yourself and like who you are.
Todd Baratz: Yeah, I would agree. I mean, you're spot on there. When you are encountering this stuff. We need to do two things, you know, we can't just give ourselves affirmation. So you have to understand why we're thinking and feeling and doing the things that we're doing and where it comes from and our story. And then like you're describing, we also then have to have these behavioral [00:30:00] things where we're going out and doing things that confirm what we want and seek and need.
Floss: So that's what that is. 
Todd Baratz: Um, but you know, getting through some of this stuff, as you're saying. It's really, um, a huge opportunity to grow and to learn about yourself. Um, but you do have to start somewhere and you do have to take action in order for this stuff to change. It's just hard. Cause oftentimes people have to do this on their own.
Yeah. I would say start with a few acts of courage and, um, it could be, it could be one a day. It could be one a week, but I think that would be a really, really great place to start.
Floss: Okay. Onto the next voice note that we have. This is from G 
Voice note 2: Hello. Uh, I'm from Australia. Uh, I'm writing to you because I have kind of recently experienced my first ever heartbreak and loss of my first love. It was a very, very amicable breakup, very much so right person, wrong time each day, thus far. And it has been far, a [00:31:00] couple of months has been very, very up and down. It's honestly, I think the worst physical and emotional pain I've ever endured. The worst thing is that I still have this hope that the right time will come along soon and then we'll get back together. I miss him so much. I miss talking to him every day. It's really hard to go from talking to someone every day to not at all. I know it takes time and relationships take work and effort. But how do I fix this? How do I get over this? Do I ever get over this? How can it hurt this badly? 
Thank you. 
Floss: Oh, my heart is breaking for you because oh my God. Heartbreak is horrendous. And what you said that G about? Um, right person wrong time. I personally feel in my experience, that's the worst kind of breakup because there is this enormous element of. And it's a lot harder to get over someone when you can't dismiss [00:32:00] them as an asshole and you can't dismiss them as they wronged me.
This happened in the relationship, whatever you can't cling to those things, because like you said, it was very. So I really really feel for you. You said two months that you said that that's quite a long time. I it's taken me years to get over some people, honestly. Um, and I would, first of all, just like to let you know that because it, two months, isn't a really long time.
I don't know how long the relationship was for, but two months is not a long time at all. Especially when so many things will remind you of this person. I really felt your pain in this voice note. So I just want to say, I feel for you so much. Everything you're feeling is so fucking normal. 
Todd Baratz: Yeah. Breakups are so excruciating, you know, it's really like being gutted or a limb gets chopped off.
It's really hard. Yeah. What's harder is that, you know, we go through this totally alone and nobody really talks about how hard it is. That's why I hear this. So often people are like, it's been two months, it's been five months. It's been six months. Like why I'm still in pain. [00:33:00] And sometimes it takes, as you were saying, years, it took me years to get over my ex you know, it takes a long time to heal and to recover.
You know, as you were saying before, with the other question, it's through this heartbreak often that we do learn the most about ourselves, what we want, what we don't want. And it's in that sense, that space of recovery that, you know, where we really can become an independent person again, but it's so, so hard.
Um, you know, there is no fixing heartbreak. Um, it's just getting through it and really soothing and regulating and being good to yourself and doing um, you're best to just acknowledge the pain and to accept the pain, as opposed to resist it by hoping that you'll get back together, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
Um, unless that's actually a feasible option. Yeah, 
Floss: I think it's so okay. To indulge in the heartbreak for a little bit. I say indulge is in. I would listen to the playlist over there and I would listen to the music and I would just like really, really, really feel [00:34:00] everything because I would go through this periods of like, I'm okay, I'm fine.
They didn't even impact my life that much anyway. And then I would hear something and then I'd be like, like a song or I'd see something to remind me of them. Uh, and I needed to just let it all out, but not to wallow in it too much. And I think that's to say. You are a person before you met this person and one day it will make sense.
And that's the worst advice ever. Actually, I hate it when people say that to me. Um, but I've something in my life has recently come full circle that everyone used to say to me, one day floss, this will mean something. And you'll be so grateful that happened to you. And I hated when everyone said that to me.
And it's really annoying because it doesn't help the pain that you're in in the moment, but there will be a day when. Back and you'll have acquired some form of wisdom and experience, perhaps a new person, a job opportunity. And you can see that there's no way in hell this would have happened. If you both didn't choose yourself.
It's not when you say right person wrong time as well. I think there's nothing [00:35:00] more beautifully heartbreaking than that because you're both choosing yourself to either grow in different directions. You're, you're refusing to let each other. Be held back by the relationship. If that's what's causing you to break up whatever it is, it's really heartbreaking.
I just want you to know it's completely normal and every single person, most people will experience painful heartbreak. The it's almost like a pressure valve. I feel it at first. Busting out the pipes and then slowly, it just becomes a little bit of a trickle. It doesn't make it any less painful. It does get better.
God, it's so annoying, such an annoying thing to say. 
Todd Baratz: Know, but it's true.
Floss: Okay. Here, we have a text from DG how to stop waiting for someone and to really relish being single. My ex and I have been on and off so much. I feel like I'm waiting for something to start up again. How do I overcome this feeling and start focusing on other things? Todd. Do you have anything to say about that one?
Todd Baratz: Yeah. I mean, for some people it's hard to [00:36:00] relish being single. It's not a place that feels exciting. Um, and they really do want companionship and partnership. And so first, you know, that's a hundred percent okay. I think there's so much shit out there right now. I've just, you know, So happy to be single and alone and independent, and this is this golden ticket to life.
But I think the practice of it's really hard for some people, depending on their context, depending on their community, their social circle, their family connectedness, you know that for some people being in a relationship feels the most comforting place that they can be. Now, the reality is that we can't just go to the store and buy a relationship. So then it leaves us in this double bind, right. Where we're not satisfied if we're not in a relationship. And we're feeling too lonely to be on our own. And so that's a challenge. Um, and so then that means, you know, Thinking about the places in our lives, the people in our lives, and really seeing what we can do to increase our connectedness to that, and bring more meaning into our lives that we can have meaning in our lives.
So without being in an intimate long-term relationship. [00:37:00] So that means being, participating with people, places, and things, um, that increase the meaning and satisfaction in your life. And if you don't know what that is, the great news, because then you can explore all the things and obviously easier said than done, but you know, if you want to feel okay on your own.
That's the place to start in terms of really putting yourself out there and developing deeper relationships with the people that you have. Also masturbating is something really helpful. You know, the pleasure we can derive from our body as something really important and empowering. 
Floss: Almost like drip, feeding, being single. If this person is like struggling to detach themselves from this person, they could. Almost, because everything you described to me is the act of being single it's, it's masturbating because you'd rather have sex with yourself than the person who's maybe not too good for you. It's almost like an addiction to comfort.
And I don't mean that in a bad way. I mean, it's like, if this is what you know, and you know, the emotions that you're going to experience from being with this person and you don't like being single then. Yeah. Like you said, it's, it's very easy to settle into that comfort with that person. [00:38:00] But if you drip feed those, those experiences of being single, it's almost like masturbating, taking yourself out for a walk somewhere. You'll start to see that you're okay. Without this person. If, if your ex is someone who's not good for you. Onto the next question. This is one from anonymous. I've been dating this guy for almost two years and we were best friends to start with. We've had a lot of ups and downs.
He's younger than me and a bit immature when it comes to relationships, conflict resolution, et cetera. I've got to the point where I think being single would be the best thing for me. I love him. He's wonderful. And he's the perfect boyfriend, but I really think I need some time alone. However, I'm not sure how to break up with someone with no concrete reason, like cheating and I don't want to hurt him.
I'm also worried if I do end. He will be a wreck and I'll feel badly and take him back. Do you have any advice for this kind of breakup and how to do it in a positive way that recognizes that love isn't lost between us? There sounds like the plot of, uh, my next fiction book. Every single [00:39:00] thing that you're speaking about here about not having a concrete reason, you've actually described quite a lot of concrete reasons. You want more for yourself? You said he's immature when it comes to conflict. And that you've tried things like this, that there are lots of ups and downs. Um, you not being satisfied in a relationship is a concrete reason. There's this guilt that comes with breaking up with someone when you feel like you've outgrown them, perhaps, you know, you've said a lot about this person being immature.
I think that that's never a nice thing to say to someone and it doesn't also need to be said. I see, I see your dilemma here. And I also want you to know that you do have a concrete reason. It just might be hard to communicate. And you might feel guilty saying those reasons out loud, and that might be what you're experiencing, but you do have a reason. You're not happy. It sounds like. 
Todd Baratz: Yeah, totally. And someone can be wonderful and we can even love them a lot. Um, and not want to be with them. And part of being in relationships is, you know, we have to expect that we're going to get hurt. We're going to hurt our partners. They're going to disappoint us. We're going to disappoint them.
It's going to happen. The focus [00:40:00] has to be on taking responsibility for yourself and letting your partner take responsibility for their self. They're an adult. They will be in pain, which they will be, and you will also be in pain ending the relationship. You know, a lack of desire to be in a relationship is a reason.
One of the things we talked about today is actually ending relationships through sadness and not through anger or, or all of the things that we see on TV. You know, this big crisis where relationship ends. Sometimes it's not like that. Sometimes it's just really sad. It's heartbreak where two people acknowledge it's not working out.
Floss: Something that really changed the way of your breakups forever was when Glenn and Doyle, who left her husband to be with a woman- who she described him as an incredible man. And she went through a lot of the same feelings that you're saying you went through a anonymous person, but she said that she eventually learned there's no such thing as one way liberation. So when she felt that she was doing a very selfish thing by leaving him, because she realized that she was gay, she realized that she also set him free to go and find someone that did love him correctly. That really [00:41:00] empowered me about making decisions that are good for you are ultimately good for the other person if it comes, if it comes to a breakup, because you liberate yourself and you honor your feelings. In this situation, you don't want to be with this man. It's going to be very hard to do, but you will end up liberating the both of you to find the person who suits you better. 
This episode actually left me feeling really quite heartbroken, hearing a lot of your pain, especially the voice notes.
Um, and even the call in, like a related to so much to Madeline what she was saying. Um, being attracted to people who want good for you.

I related to what so many of you were talking about, and I really, really hope that some of my very unprofessional and Todd's very professional and advice have helped you come to some kind of realizations of solutions yourself.
