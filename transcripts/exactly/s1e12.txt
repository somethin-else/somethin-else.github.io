EXACTLY. With Florence Given. Episode 12: SOCIAL MEDIA: Cancel Culture, Community and Accountability

Floss: [00:00:00] Hello. Thank you so much for listening to Exactly with me Florence Given. For the last three episodes. I've been talking to my guests Layla Saad, Ayishat Akanbi and Larz May all about social media. They've all had such incredible and insightful things to say. And it's so good to chat about this stuff, because so much of it, we experienced just in our heads with our phones in our hands and it can feel quite isolating. I found it super enlightening and thought provoking. And I can't wait to hear your thoughts and talk to you today about what you've learned. Today I have another incredible guest joining me to help article questions. The psychologist Seerut Chawla
So today's, it's the fourth and final episode in this mini series on social media. And today we're sharing the mic with you. This is your chance to ask the questions that you care about. And today Seerut and I are going to be answering as many of them as we can. Seerut is a psychotherapist who lives in London.
She's practiced in the NHS and now runs her own private [00:01:00] practice. She has a special interest in personal responsibility and resilience, and now teaches that in an online membership. I'm a huge fan of Seerut, and I followed her for some time on Instagram. And I'm so excited to have her with me today. I think I followed her about over a year ago, I'd seen some of her quotes being shared on social media and a lot like the other guest I've had on this series for social media Ayishat, it almost felt illegal to be engaging with her content. Not because it's radical, not because it's quote unquote problematic, but because she says the things that are in the very depths of my mind, and I'm not talking about like criminal thoughts, I'm talking about going against the grain of whatever on social media is saying and Seerut is a breath of fucking fresh air.
She has an enormous emphasis in Hawaii on personal responsibility. She believes that the kind of self-help and self care circles on Instagram, [00:02:00] they were originally created to help us, but in a way on our hindering us, as we learn to constantly validate our own feelings and not sit in any discomfort, she talks a lot about how discomfort isn't actually a bad thing.
Um, and I totally agree with her, you know, I feel like I have moved from one space of perfectionism to another, where you can kind of get trapped in this cycle of constantly wanting to improve yourself. Um, and that's just no place to really live. You know, we live in the gray area as human beings and you don't, it's not, it's not black and white.
It's not good or bad. It's not perfect. I liked that she very much presents healing as a journey to her audience. Um, I cannot wait to hear what she has to say today. 
Thank you so much for coming onto my podcast today. Seerut, I love your work. 
Seerut: I love yours. I really do. You're one of the only people who talks about feminism in a way that actually I think, oh yeah, that makes sense.
I like that. I've learned from that. 
Floss: That's sick. That's amazing. I feel the same way about [00:03:00] you. Um, as a therapist on Instagram, it's very cool. So wait, before we get into all of the questions that we have from my listeners, I have five icebreaker questions that I ask all of my guests, the first thing that comes to your mind. 
Seerut: Okay. 
Floss: What's one thing that's actual soul on fire?
Seerut: Music
Floss: Gorgeous!, any song, album, in particular genre? 
Seerut: Uh, at the moment, I'm just really obsessed with Dusty Springfield and just going back and listening to everything.
Floss: If you could, if you could wear one outfit for the rest of your life, and it would be a look that could define you forever, what would that be? 
Seerut: That was very easy because I already do that , I wear the same thing every day..
Floss: Okay. What is it then?
Seerut: I wear a uniform of at home it's black sweatpants when I go out it's black trousers or black jeans. And it's the same H and M v-neck black top that I wear, I have like 16 of them. 
Floss: I'm the same with a white tank top and [00:04:00] denim jeans. It's like, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Right. It's like, just go for it.
Seerut: Yeah. 
Floss: Okay. What's something that people frequently misunderstand or get wrong about. 
Seerut: That they think I'm angry, you're hostile or something like that. Um, and I'm just a little bit Aspy and just straightforward in my speech. And it's really interesting that the projections I get onto just onto that one thing, 
Floss: I think we're used to people lying to us, this culture of like telling people, maybe, what they want to hear and you refuse to do that. So that's probably perceived as aggressive or hostile. Okay. The next question, finish the sentence. I'm still working progress when it comes to.
Seerut: Health and fitness.
Floss: Okay the last question on my icebreaker questions. When was the last time you majorly cringed at yourself? 
Seerut: Oh my god. I do it every single day. Every day. Like, you know, even like you put a post up in the morning and the afternoon, you're like, oh.
Floss: Yes, yes.[00:05:00] 
Um, first of all, I just want to say you were one of the first people I said I wanted to have on the show before. Fucking off what you say. I'm so glad that we finally got to do this. Okay. So today we are, we are going to have some questions from my listeners and you're here to help me out to them. So the first question is how to have balance perspective and self-awareness when taking part in social politics online? 
Seerut: Well that's was a big question. Really big question. First you'd want to start with making sure you're emotionally regulated, because the second you're like disregulated or activated, you're going to start getting a bit more binary in your thinking you're going to lose self-awareness and start focusing on what seems like a threat.
I have a rule when I, if I'm feeling activated or threatened or angry, I try not to respond from that place to anyone or anything. Especially in real life relationships.
Floss: So, what would you do in the, in that time where you're feeling disregulated? Um, if it's [00:06:00] online and I'm feeling disregulated, I'll just turn, it's like, I remind myself, this is just an app on my phone, that's it?
Um, and I'll just close it and go away. I feel quite resentful to think that an app on my phone could have such a big hold on my life. So I would go away from that. And if it's, it's not always easy for people to do that. And I want to, I want to acknowledge that because some of these kinds of political discussions get really nasty really personal.
Seerut: Well, what you say is looked at what you don't say is looked at. So even if it's just acknowledging in that moment to cover your ass and say, look, I'm feeling emotionally, not okay right now. And I'm just going to go away and I'll come back to this. Yeah, 
Floss: yeah. I think it's like, like you said, um, of course they're switching off, but now this is infiltrating almost every aspect of our lives, where you could be even like exiled or pushed out of a friendship group for not posting or posting the wrong thing. And so yet it does impact social relations. 
Seerut: It has a huge, real life impact offline impact. Especially the [00:07:00] first time I got canceled, I went through the great unfriending and like, you just. So many friends or people quietly just turn away from you and they don't unfollow you or people that, you know, in real life have something to say.
Floss: I find there is a difference though, between how people operate online and how they do offline, um, when it comes to maybe what they say about you or something, you know, I've had friends unfollow me without telling me, and then I'll see them in person, they're like, Hey, how are you doing? It's very odd. And I think that's when I realized a lot of people don't even believe what they say online. It's out of fear. And I think I Ayishat actually compares it to like a high school canteen, the digital canteen, where it's like siding with people in the canteen, like for protection. Yeah. It's very like primitive and animalistic and survival mode. I've had girls write tweets about me and then try to match me on hinge afterwards.
It's it's so weird. Um, and just goes to show that like a lot of people it's, it's, it's all talk and it's very wild, but 
it's also an insight into their personality, um, that I wouldn't [00:08:00] ignore personally. Absolutely not. 
Yeah. Yeah. But yeah, I think like going back to this person's question, like, how do you gain that?
Self-awareness taking part in social politics online. I would say, um, ground yourself in real life experiences and things that you know are true because the online world can become so distorting for me It's sometimes as simple as going for a walk in the morning, maintaining my rituals to know that real life does matter and that a lot of the things and the theory that we apply online, doesn't actually translate to real life.
Seerut: And to this person's question, I'd say you need to work on self-awareness outside of the situation to have self-awareness in it. 
So the next question that asked here is what should you do if you make a genuine mistake online, let's assume they mean the mistake has happened online and not something you did privately.
It depends because you know, people are so terrified of making mistakes. Now, I think you have to be really. Grounded and forum in [00:09:00] yourself and decide for yourself, even if you can't help thinking about how it's going to be perceived in what the mob might do. You have to compartmentalize that and first think about what's right for you.
Generally, most of us, that way, if we fuck up, you want to try and make it right. So if you actually want to do that, do that, if you haven't done something wrong and you're being told you. Don't do it. Don't apologize, but I'd also be really careful with it because the word accountability has been, been subject to concept creep and really account. When I hear the term accountability. Now it almost immediately has associations with harassment, bullying or mob rule.. Yeah. So, um, I think unfortunately you have to also be really careful with it because there are people who will see you apologizing or see you in a moment of vulnerability and then behave like vultures..
And try and make it into something or insert themselves in the situation or try and be weirdly authoritarian about it. So unfortunately you have to balance what it [00:10:00] is that you want to do with a sense of self protection. 
Floss: Yeah, I, I associate the same thing with the word. Accountability is it's so annoying because accountability is actually like such a beautiful thing to have in interpersonal relationships.
It's how you help each other grow accountability to me, looks like holding your own perspective and appreciate what you've done or said could also harm another person and saying, yeah, I'm really sorry. I'll I won't say that again. Or can we find a way to work around this without me compromising myself or so, like, that's what accountability would look like to me.
Seerut: That's a beautiful definition.
Floss: Yeah. It's been completely warped, I think. And it's something that, um, I I've written about in my book. My first book women, don't owe you pretty. I wrote about accountability. Uh, you know, in its truest sense in those interpersonal relationships, but at its heart, I know what accountability is, what it looks like. And it's not harassing people online.
Seerut: No. No. Okay. The next question is a voice note from Jessica. 
Voice note 1: Hi florence. It's Jess, and I'm a huge fan of [00:11:00] your podcast. My question about social media is why are girls so are like obsessed with how many likes they get on social media? 
Floss: Okay, thank you, Jessica. I would say we're obsessed with social media likes because it's the quickest most transactional way to feel good about ourselves.
I find myself reaching for my phone in moments of boredom. I have to intentionally tell myself to sit and feel how I'm feeling. I think it's so easy to grab your phone and it's validation, and it's a way to feel good about yourself quickly. That requires minimal effort. And I think that that's what we're seeing a lot through.
There's so many other reasons behind it, but Seerut what do you have to say? 
Seerut: I think being obsessed with likes is, you know, it's like a feedback loop because you get the dopamine with the likes, you know, a dopamine rush, a sense of reward. It feels really good. And then you want more and then you get it and then you want more. And it's kind of like, you know, you notice when, um, if you post something and it doesn't get very many likes how much that impacts your mood. That has a very real neuro-biological [00:12:00] impact. And the other thing, I think from an evolutionary point of view, it's also about acceptance from the tribe. You know, as soon as you get likes, you're being sort of told that what you have to say is valuable, um, that you're accepted, it's sort of the opposite of rejection and that's what we, that's what we crave. Don't we? 
Floss: Yeah. A sense of belonging. Yeah. Yeah. So I guess in a way, social media, kind of mines that human need. And actually the thing that I know you talk about as well with council culture and all this kind of stuff, is that, that's also what it does is it gives the person experiencing that the worst form of like being removed from human content, almost being like a non-person.
Seerut: Yeah, it's horrible because it's like, you know, nasty mean girl bullying that we've all been subject to. But at scale. And if you notice the people who do most of these harassment campaigns, they're all women, it's like women's interpersonal violence against women. I really find this [00:13:00] quite fascinating in a very horrifying, disturbing kind of way women tearing down women.
Floss: And I think the, um, the term is relational aggression. So, um, what, what, what you're talking about it being on like such a huge scale of women, it actually is like being in high school. Um, where women hurt each other through our relationships. We know that the worst thing is exiled. Yeah. We know that the worst thing is to be exiled from the group it's to be isolated, but yet it's relational aggression on steroids. It's it's complete isolation. Yeah. 
Seerut: And the impact that has on you, like, even on your primitive brain to think like you're kind of being exiled from the. And for most of our history, if you were exiled from the tribe, you wouldn't survive you'd actually die.
Floss: So true. Okay. Moving on to the next question. How do you allow yourself to be authentic online and not give in to following the norms?
Seerut: I think it can, it can be a little bit [00:14:00] of a journey and I'd love to hear yours as well. Like if you scroll back to the beginning of my, when I first started posting my first posts, are like utter dog shit. 
Floss: Yes. You mean, do you mean you truly believed what you said at the time and now you disagree with it or you were pretending to be something else back then?
Seerut: No, I think my first post were just completely clueless and really ugly and just really bad. I think you have to, you have to kind of get comfortable being online. You have to get comfortable with what it's like to have an audience because it's not a trivial thing. Through that process and continually anchoring back to yourself and your, um, your values and just being who you are.
So I think of myself sometimes as a reluctant influencer, because I hate so much about social media and the way people behave on there, that, um, I'm really determined to be as awkwardly difficult and different as possible. 
Floss: I would agree because you almost can't authentically. Show up and [00:15:00] be yourself online. At least that wasn't my experience. I didn't even show my face on Instagram for awhile. It was just, um, my illustrations and that's what I started off with, and sharing my political slogans. And I was 18 at the time and I was sharing them and it was all very authentic. It was all very what I wanted to say. And then I showed my face. It changed how people interacted with me because I was young. I still am young. You just have to build a fuck ton of resilience because it's not going to be easy, but it gets easier, the further you push and you don't have to push yourself to reach like the most amount of followers you can possibly get. But if you're someone like me who has a message, I know that I want to write books for the rest of my life. I want to do my podcast. I want to do all of this stuff. So I need to get used to. Uh, people challenging, people saying nasty things. Cause I know that I want to do this for a long time. So I would just say, think about what you want, put your stuff out there, [00:16:00] uh, I've said this before, but like, nothing is more depressing than the thought of my illustration still remaining taped up on my bedroom wall where I would have left them. Like that thought is so haunting to me, just like hanging with the sellotape on the wall. If I never took pictures of them and put them online, I wouldn't be doing this today. Get used to. Your internal voice and having some kind of rock to cling to inside of yourself, uh, or a support system around you to remind you of who you are when the internet gets a bit odd. 
Seerut: Yeah. And also you have to think of it. Like if you walk into a group of people or a party full of strangers, you're not going to walk in and be a hundred percent yourself. You're going to be a little bit guarded a little bit unsure until, you know, maybe, been there a few hours or you've met them a few times and then you can start to be more comfortable and be yourself. And I think it's a really similar process with starting to show up on the internet and also be aware that being online and having an audience will change you. It's like, it's like growth on steroids. I feel like. 
Floss: [00:17:00] Yes! 
So the next question we have is from a caller, their name's Beth. Hey Beth. Thank you so much for calling today. 
Call In 1: No worries. How are you guys? 
Floss: I'm good. Thank you. How are you? 
Call In 1: I'm good. I'm good. Lovely to meet you all.
Floss: So what would you like to ask us today? 
Call In 1: I would like to ask how I can use social media as a platform, inspiration as well as educating myself, rather than just coming away, feeling deflated self-conscious and just basically constantly comparing myself to others. That's something that I. I'm struggling with. And I just would like, you know, a couple of methods of dealing with that basically. 
Floss: Do you know when you feel crap after coming off social media? Like when is it, is it certain type of content or is it a general. Crap feeling you get from being on the app. 
Call In 1: Yeah, it is the content that I follow and I think sometimes it is a bit of, um, toxically doing it to myself. I know that I am, I follow a lot of photography accounts because I [00:18:00] am a young photographer. That's what I'm studying at the moment and also getting fashion inspiration, but it's separating the two is inspiration education, basically just not feeling shit about myself. 
Floss: Seerut. Do you have anything to say to that? 
Seerut: I was just wondering if, cause you said that you feel like you also do it to yourself and I was wondering what need that meant for you, what you get from, from that. What makes you go back and do it again? 
Call In 1: Obviously these people that I follow have a certain aesthetic that I like. Not necessarily, that's something good that I need. Maybe it's, you know, almost an obsession that I keep on going back to because that's just who I follow. And then it's actually, maybe do I need to make the effort of just on following those people, you know, because actually they're not inspiration, it's just putting me down.
Seerut: Yeah. Maybe you can do an, uh, like, um, inventory of the people you follow and think about is it a net positive or a net negative to follow [00:19:00] this person. And also just from a practical point of view, you could have two accounts. You could have one for your obsession that you only look at once in a while, and you could start to phase yourself into a new account. So like, I often think when you're starting something new, don't focus so much on tearing down the old focus on building the new. So maybe start a new account, which is going to be your new way of being. And only follow the kind of people that, um, nourish you and educate you and bring you and inspire you and all that. All the good things. 
Floss: Yeah. That's such a good point about focusing on building the news that of tearing down the old, because also that is a part of you. It might move into another area of your life. If it's the obsessive part of it, it might move into something else. And I think for me, that was, I was in that place of following all of these people that didn't make me feel very good about myself, like a few years ago. I think it's like taking back that power, like that is your media source that you have control over. So I would [00:20:00] definitely recommend unfollowing people and like, Seerut said, doing like the net, uh, like weighing up whether it's overall good or overall bad. Um, I think that's a really good idea because yeah some things can, they can either inspire you. Brilliant women, uh, inspire me. And I've worked really hard to like turn around those feelings of jealousy, which still come up. But if I feel them and I can feel these thoughts rising in my head to go, what is this about? Oh, it's because I want what she has. It's because there's an area of her life that she is better at than me. Is there a YouTube tutorial? I need to watch to learn how to do what she can do. That's what I've like, switched it around in my head. But again, there's, there's a certain type of woman that I will just never be. And I've accepted that in myself now. Yeah, it is. It's so easy to just say, stop comparing yourself. So I think it's probably a good idea to have like a detox and go through the list of people that you're following. 
Seerut: The other thing is don't beat yourself up because it's, um, the app is designed to make you feel that. You know, the [00:21:00] app is set up for comparison. And when you think about like, how can I use this in a better way? And when I've been asked this before, I often think it's like saying, oh, how can I use cocaine in a better way? Like, you know, you're dealing with like dangerous substance. So it's always going to have an element of, of messing with your head. So it's not all you. And I think that's really important to think about as well is that it's not you failing at something, it's the app doing what is designed to do.
And I think you're asking really good questions because you're thinking about how you can mitigate the negative impacts of the app. 
Call In 1: Thank you so much, guys. 
Seerut: You're welcome, good luck.
Floss: okay. That was so wonderful. I love doing the call-ins cause it's so nice to talk to an actual person. 
Seerut: It is it's so, and it makes such a difference. Doesn't it? It's like you feel so much more invested in wanting to help when you see the person's face. [00:22:00] And I think like social media has completely robbed us of that, which also is why we're so foul to each other on the internet.
Floss: I know. Yes, it's so good. Okay. So the next question that we've been sent in here, how does being canceled impact the person who's canceled? 
Seerut: Wow.
Floss: Is such a broad question. 
Seerut: How does it not impact you? It impacts you like across the board. You lose. You've become really disillusioned about relationships. I think because there's so many people that you think would have had your back that just kind of quietly turn away or, um, you become isolated.
And I think the level of harassment that you can get when you're canceled and I don't think people understand what it's like, cause it's not just what they see. You know, some posts here in the. You know, some mean comments. It's like a deluge of DMS. It's like your friends turning away from you, people trying to ruin your professional life. Um, stories will be made up [00:23:00] about you. Your reputation is kind of destroyed. Um, you know, there's so much that, um, For me, like, I'm, I'm trying to be more open about this. Cause I think it's really important, but my cancellation went on so long, so many months, the first one, and it was so relentless that I started to have suicidal ideation. Like, so it wasn't actually suicidal, but I was thinking about how much easier would it be if I just, if I just ended it, cause I wouldn't have to deal with this anymore. Especially when your income and your career is tied to the internet, there's no escape. You just have hundreds. Sometimes thousands of people. Just harassing you month after month after month and lying about you. And the psychological impact of that is really profound. And I think it, it still impacts me in different ways. It made me harder. It was one of the reasons I talk about it so much is because I am pretty tough. I do have, my mood is generally very stable. My mental health is quite robust and that's how it impacted me. [00:24:00] So how would it impact somebody who's much younger or in a more vulnerable place? 
Floss: I'm really sorry that you experienced that. Um, I didn't know that about you. I just found your content like a year and a half ago. Um, but I have like a big spot in my life for people who've been through all of that kind of stuff. Cause I just think it's, I just think it's so. Um, it's so cruel. And I, one of the main reasons I started this podcast was so that I could talk to human beings instead of people on the internet, because I do think that it, it decreases the empathy. So even you now talking about suicidal ideation, we see we've even now learned to not really feel how the gravity of what that actually means. Um, because we hear the word. Yes, that's desensitized. Exactly. That's the word? Um, so like, That's why I wanted to do this podcast was because I want people to see each other as people again.[00:25:00] 
Okay. The next question, I feel like if I post anything on social media that I'm showing off and I feel really bad, but when other people do it, I think it looks so cool. How can I stop being so hard on myself? 
I want to say one thing that it does feel weird to share things about yourself unprompted. That's a completely, normal thing. Um, I think it's just become our norm now. And so when everyone's doing everything well, if you can't beat them, join them. And so we're now having to do this uncomfortable thing of sharing ourselves with the world. So if you do feel a hesitation, that's completely normal. 
Seerut: That's completely normal. And there's no reason that you have to do it just because everybody else is doing it. It doesn't mean that you have to, and some of us are more private. I'm more private. I don't share almost anything personal about myself on my Instagram. Or my face very often. I'm trying to get a bit better about the face things so people can see I'm an actual human being, but it's okay to have your life be private [00:26:00] and it's okay to only share part it's okay.
To only share the highlight reel. Like let's break that idea down. It's okay to only share what you want to share and what you want to show. And let's not forget that this is like a parasocial relationship. So you have an audience of people and you're like, oh, look at my new handbag. It's just weird. But that is something really, maybe it's because I'm a bit older and like, I didn't grow up with this, but I still find so much of it so weird. 
Floss: I only feel uncomfortable doing something. If I feel like it's an inaccurate representation of my life. Is it a photo shoot? I did where I cried afterwards that I now have to share. That makes me feel uncomfortable. That's when I feel inauthentic because it's like, well, do I have a responsibility to tell people, or is that something I keep to myself because that was a really hard day for me? And I just had a breakdown because of something I thought I was over. And clearly I'm not, there's all of this. Like what do you owe your audience? And the answer is nothing. And yet as someone with a platform, we also do have a lot of power and influence over how [00:27:00] people think about themselves. It's so odd. I'm constantly like back and forth with this, um, stuff, but I never do something that feels forced anymore when it comes to showing up on social media, I think. If it feels a bit forced and you feel like you're saying something to say something that's probably not the best place to come from. 
Seerut: And I think it's, I find it really sinister what you just said. Cause it sounds like you were almost conditioned when you were quite young to start sharing yourself publicly on, on Facebook and stuff. And you got used to sort of giving parts of yourself away. Again. I think that's just such a disservice that we've done to your generation. Because you don't start from this orientation of being private and having privacy, you start from the orientation of like almost exhibitionism. Like that's what, that's, what being online is, isn't it? Voyeurism and exhibition.
Floss: Absolutely. Yes. That's the default of, uh, young people now is to even, even like, [00:28:00] um, I'm sure he won't mind me saying this, my friend, the other day, we were going to go to a party. And I was like, right. Let's let's get a Uber um, because it will be like quicker together. And he was like, no, let's get the tube so we can take a Tik TOK on the way. So it's like even the, even like the, the, um, the commodification of like the commute has become about what can we get from this commute? And it's funny, you know, he wanted to get like a cool video of us, whatever, but again, it's the commodification of everything that you do, but yeah, everything. Kind of become commodified and we do come from a default now of exhibitionism as opposed to privacy. 
Seerut: Yeah. The things people show online, crying selfies and, um, the most private, intimate parts of their relationship or that personal, you know, my using like my bad childhood as part of your brand, like all of this stuff, it's just like, what are we doing? I feel like we're veering so far off piste of what, um, [00:29:00] Taking sacred things and then using them as like bait. So you can Hawk some courses in a book. Like it's one thing to tell your story and own your story and be open about it. It's another thing to use these things in this very sort of contrived mercenary way to, um, to make money.
Floss: Mercenary, what does that mean? 
Seerut: Uh, motivated by money later. I don't think people necessarily know how much they're manipulated on social media. It's not people sharing. It's people marketing and building brands. 
Floss: Uh, pain initially was shared on social media to relate, so other people could feel less lonely. And now people have seen that that works. And in some spaces it's become a commodity. 
Seerut: I feel really strongly that if you share something, you should share it because you want to share it. I don't think you should take your personal history and almost disrespect it like that. 
Floss: Um, you don't have to put it online. The opposite side to that though, to [00:30:00] not sharing which I've experienced is being grossly misunderstood. So Seerut when you spoke about experiencing suicidal ideation, you know, I feel that I, there are so many things I would like to talk about because a lot of people get things wrong about me. Um, and I want to constantly, almost the ego comes in and wants everyone to understand me. It wants everyone to know that I'm not that person I've been through this, I've done [...] but then you can kind of move into that space of constantly defending yourself. Um, so like when you spoke about your suicidal ideation, it's probably also because a lot of people assume things of you that are just deeply uncomfortable and you want to be like, that's not true. It's not just like that. It's, it's actually a lot worse than that. And. If you want to go, that this is how it made me feel. And I, I it's so deeply painful to be misunderstood by people. So when you don't tell people the things, it leaves room for this [00:31:00] assumption about you like an all they fill in the gaps with their minds.
Right. So I think sometimes in my experience and with people, I know we've shared stuff about ourselves because we are so fed up of being misunderstood and of people assuming the wrong things. So I think it's, sometimes it could also be like a protection thing. 
Seerut: It's true. And there's a lot of conflicting feelings there because there was a time where I did try to keep explaining things. I didn't want to be misunderstood and it felt really difficult to be misunderstood. And so kind of harshly and punitively judged. And then I think as time went on, it shifted or how it shifted, but I've also like personally had a really difficult time. The last few years I've lost three people. Um, my mom died last year to COVID. It was, you know, like I've been grieving and so much of the social media stuff then kind of pales in comparison and the way I think about it, I don't need to explain myself to strangers. They can have [00:32:00] whatever assumptions of me they like. And I think you almost get to the point where you're desensitized to it. Like it's not only just tolerating being misunderstood. It's like, you're actually hardened to it, like, Yeah, like, it's almost like you built a callus there cause you've been cut. They're repeated you just end up building a callus there. Yeah. You get to the point where it's just like, okay. Yeah. I don't like, I'm not getting involved in it. I'm going to be, I'm going to be focusing on what I want to say and whatever tone you read it in is none of my fucking business. I know what I said. 
Floss: I I think that, yeah, there was definitely a time for me where other people's opinions of me would have like shaken me to my core. Um, and now I think I've, I've built the callous.
So we now have another voice note from grace. 
Voice note 2: Hi floss. My name is grace. I [00:33:00] just want to say women don't know you parade has changed my life. The good. Not lived the same life since reading it. My question is how do you make friends on social media online? I am way too scared to message people out of the blue. I just don't have enough confidence with that. And I'm scared that commenting on pictures on Instagram will just attract a load of weirdos. Thank you so much. Bye. 
Oh, grace. That was so wonderful. Um, just want to say thank you for all the lovely words you said. I brought my book. I want to say that you're not alone. Um, I think a lot of women want to be friends with each other and we have these boundaries between us. They all very real, but they're all very much in our heads. We all assume, assume, assume, assume. So. I am the same. I think that so many women are cooler than me. I think so many women. Um, more so almost [00:34:00] intimidating levels of cool that I would feel almost like approaching them would be like offensive and just cause like, wow, you're so cool. What am I going up talking to you. And I don't know if that helps to hear me say it, but we all have those, uh, feelings as well. That's probably the main reason why I do those Instagram posts, where I say make friends and flirt in the comments, because I know that a lot of women want to be friends with each other, but don't feel comfortable approaching. I met my friends actually I'm bisexual. So I met women. A lot of my friends through dating apps, dates that ended up being like, let's actually just be friends. There's nothing sexual here, but I want you in my life forever. And you're incredible. There are so many clubs that you can attend. I personally find sharing the things that you love online. Doesn't have to be your own content. It could be other people's content. And then those other people sometimes just going, oh my God, I also love this band. Let's go to their gig together. They're playing this weekend, whatever. Being a bit more open and being a bit more [00:35:00] brave is going to pay off. And I trust you, the world is not as scary as social media or have you believe when it comes to other women and what we all desire, which deep down I believe is connection with one another. But there are just a lot of things between us.
Seerut: That was such a good answer! You know. . Yeah. I completely agree with share. What sets your soul on fire what's really important to you? What's really meaningful to you? Cause I really think like if you start walking down the path, like your path and the stuff that really is meaningful to you, that you're really passionate about, you will naturally meet people. Like-minded people, as you walk down that path.
Floss: Okay. Seerut We have a last question here. And it's another voice note from Jasmine. 
Voice note 3: I'm a student at university. I work for women's charity in Glasgow, and I'm a writer and activist, a feminist. I made the decision through lockdown to [00:36:00] delete all of my social media, uh, for various reasons, mostly because I feel like the detriments that has to me as a woman and my mental health is not. The benefits, however, as an aspiring writer, um, this obviously causes some barriers. And so my question is how can I have my voice heard and how can I have a career in writing and journalism and activism without having to use social media?
Floss: That's a very good question. And as somebody who has only ever used social media to put my writing out there, I don't know of the traditional route of journalism. 
Seerut: There's a few things. One you, of course you don't have to use social media. And intelligent use of show. Social media is really useful because it's free real estate. Right? You find your little patch of the internet and you plant your flag in that. You kind of get your message out there. And I think that's one of the few positives of social media. There's so many [00:37:00] career opportunities. I'm sure both of us have the wouldn't exist because of social media. Like if it wasn't for social media. 
Floss: Like, I really liked your analogy of it being free real estate, because I think there are ways that you can interact with social media that aren't detrimental to your health. If the, if, uh, Jasmine has deleted all of their social media, maybe because of the comparison element and that it wasn't helping them with their mental health, perhaps a different way to engage with that would be creating a new page that just showcases their work and their writing as almost like a portfolio to show the kind of stuff that you want to do. Definitely the reason why I started my Instagram was as a portfolio of my work and then just kind of built it from there. And then you don't even have to follow anyone. 
Seerut: That's exactly. You don't have to. There's so many accounts that do that, that literally just come online, fire off the, whatever it is into the echo chamber, and then they don't follow anyone. They don't respond to comments. It's just that it's like a message board and they post it and then they go [00:38:00] away. But the other thing I just thought of, if it's writing, why not use something like Substack? 
Floss: What such good idea. 
Seerut: You can monetize it, you know, that can be your income source and you have the opportunity to write long form, which of course you can't do on social media. You don't have to have any interaction. You just publish your writing. 
Floss: Also like, it's just, it's way more intentional because people are choosing to be that I feel like with Instagram, because it's such like a multifaceted space, people use it for personal, they use it for business. They, and like you said, almost everything now is becoming a marketing strategy, but on sub stack, that is, that is a place for people to put their writing.
That's a, that's a really good tangible tip there. And I think that was great. 
Oh, my God. I love talking with Seerut today. She has obviously been through a lot with social media and it's really refreshing to see her turn into something that almost like a, how to guides. That's what I feel like her social media is.
